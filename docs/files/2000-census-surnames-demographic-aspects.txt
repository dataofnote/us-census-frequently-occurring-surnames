1. INTRODUCTION

A person’s name is one of the most basic pieces of information that describes them.
Moreso than a person’s race, sex or age, we most often recognize people by their name.
But names are not divorced from other aspects of an individual. Often, by knowing a
name, we can infer many other things about the person. Names also have a historical
context, ebbing and increasing over time with changes in popular culture.

This report documents both the overall frequency of surnames (last names), as well as
some of the basic demographic characteristics that are associated with surnames. The
presentation of data in this report focuses on summarized aggregates of counts and
characteristics associated with surnames, and, as such, do not in any way identify
any specific individuals.

The data for this project were taken from records from the 2000 decennial census of
population. The primary purposes of the U.S. decennial census of population are to
provide data with geographic detail on the population for use in reapportionment and
redistricting, and administering governmental programs. However, for decades,
decennial census data have been used by government agencies, researchers,
academicians, businesses, the news media, and many others to describe and understand
demographic trends and patterns in the U.S. population.

In releasing any data or information from the decennial census, the U.S. Census Bureau
has a legal obligation under Title 13 of the U.S. Code to protect the confidentiality of
individuals’ information. In this regard, individual questionnaires of any specific census,
(generally of interest for genealogical and historical research), are not released by the
National Archives until 72 years after that specific census has been taken. Additionally,
no public-use microdata files of any type contain name information



                                             1
This report has been undertaken to provide a better understanding of the overall
distribution of surnames in the population, and to provide some idea of the relationship
between surnames and basic demographic characteristics such as gender, race and
ethnicity. Even in this highly aggregate form, this information may be helpful in
genealogical, marketing, and cultural research, as well as a variety of other applications.
As such, it is useful information in helping to understand the ever-changing nature of the
cultural mosaic that helps to define our nation.


2. THE BASE DATA

While Census 2000 is the first decennial census that permits examining demographic
detail with names, this report is by no means the first to present tabulations of names.
The Social Security Administration has published counts of frequently occurring
surnames numerous times (SSA, 1957, 1964, 1975, 1985). Their tabulations consist of
surnames of all people who had obtained Social Security Numbers as of the dates of these
reports. The number of distinct surnames reported have ranged from about 1,500 (SSA,
1957) to over 8,000 (SSA, 1985). These names, however, have been limited to six
characters. Six characters are certainly sufficient to uniquely identify shorter names like
SMITH, BROWN and JONES. On the other hand, a name such as MARTIN could be
MARTIN, or, it could be something like MARTINI, or MARTINEZ. The Social
Security Administration has had ongoing data releases on the first names of newborns for
each year since 1990 (SSA, 2003). SSA’s first compilation of newborns first names was
released in Shackleford (1998). These data, however, lack race and ethnicity information
and are limited to the 1,000 most frequent male first names and the 1,000 most frequent
female first names.

In July 1995, the Census Bureau placed summary information on male and female first
names and last names on its website (Census Bureau, 1995). The data released in 1995
were created from a sample of 7.2 million census records (about 3 percent of the
population) developed as part of the 1990 Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) operation,
following the 1990 decennial census. Word and Perkins (1996) have used these same
data to develop a Spanish surname list, also available from the Census Bureau

This report uses name responses from almost 270 million people with valid name
information in Census 2000. As part of the Census 2000 form, individuals were asked to
print their name, as well as the names of all other persons enumerated at a given address.
All information on the census forms, including written information such as names, was
captured in an optical scanning process conducted at four census processing centers
around the country. After scanning, the original forms were shredded and destroyed.
The scanned forms were then converted into strings of characters data, using optical
character recognition software (OCR). These strings of characters become the base data
for use in this report. More discussion about the process of converting the written-in
names to data, including the assumptions used to define and edit names, will be discussed
in the section, “Methodology of Measuring Names”.

3. CHARACTERISTICS OF SURNAMES

3.1 How many names are there?

Even after applying various edits and acceptance criteria to the names, there are a sizable
number of unique names in the population. Over 6 million last names were identified.
Many of these names were either unique (occurred once) or nearly so (occurred 2-4
times) raising questions about the actual validity of the name. Cursory examination of
the data indicates that many of these unique names were probably the entire name of the
person (first and last, or first, middle initial and last) concatenated into a single
continuous string, with some other information. At this time, it is not possible to easily
break a fully concatenated name back into its’ constituent parts. Doing so, however,
would have reduced the counts of unique names sizably, while only slightly increasing
the numbers of person with more common names. While a relatively large proportion of
all names relate to only one person or a few people, a large proportion of the entire
population can be identified with a relatively small proportion of all names. Table 1
better explains this phenomenon.

Table 1 shows the frequency of last names and the numbers of people who are defined by
them. Seven last names are held by a million or more people. The most common last
name reported was SMITH, held by about 2.3 million people, or about .9 percent of the
population. Another 6 names with over a million respondents (JOHNSON, WILLIAMS,
BROWN, JONES, MILLER and DAVIS), along with SMITH, account for about 4
percent of the population, or one in every 25 people. There are another 268 last names
each occurring at least 100,000 times, but less than 1 million times. Together, these 275
last names, just 4/100,000 of all reported last names, account together for 26 percent of
the population, or about one of every four people. On the flip side of this distribution,
about 65 percent (or 4 million) of all captured last names were held by just one person,
and about 80 percent (or 5 million) were held by no more than 4 people.

3.2 Characteristics of surnames

Table A-1 shows the distribution of the top 50 last names in terms of numeric count,
crosstabulated by Race/Hispanic origin. As Section 4.4.7 explains, race data in this
analysis is constructed so that any person identified as Hispanic is placed in that
classification, regardless of reported race. As such, race identification is used only for
those persons who are not Hispanic.

As can be seen, many surnames have race/Hispanic distributions that appear to be quite
distinct from the race/Hispanic distribution of the population as a whole. Especially in
the case of the Hispanic population, which constitutes about 12 percent of the overall
population in this study, it is clear that there are names which might be characterized as
strongly “Hispanic” last names. In Table A1 this includes such names as GARCIA,
RODRIQUEZ, MARTINEZ, HERNANDEZ, LOPEZ, GONZALEZ, and several others.
Each of these surnames have race/Hispanic proportions which are over 90 percent
Hispanic.

While other surnames have strong associations with specific race groups, none show the
kind of strength in association as with these Hispanic-related names. The name
MILLER, for example belongs about 86 percent of the time to persons classified as
White, while Whites make up about 70 percent of this population. BAKER is another


                                              4
        surname with a higher-than average percentage of White ownership, at 82 percent.
        Among Black persons there appear to be high-than-expected occurrences for names such
        as WILLIAMS, JACKSON, HARRIS AND ROBINSON, for example.

        Large differentials for persons in the race categories of American Indian/Alaskan Native,
        Asian/Pacific Islander and persons choosing two or more races, are less clear in the short
        list of the fifty highest occurring last names. For this reason, the list of the 1000 most
        frequently occurring last names was examined with a view toward identifying those last
        names that are held by the highest concentration of a single race/Hispanic group.

        Table 2 shows, for each race/Hispanic group, the ten last names with the highest relative
        concentration for that group. Included in this table is the name, the overall rank of that
        name out of the top 1000 last names, the total number of persons with that last name, its
        frequency per 100,000 people in the population, and the percentage of people holding
        that name that occupy the race/Hispanic group in which it is shown.

Last names which are ‘dominated’ by a single race/Hispanic group are not necessarily
names which occur in high relative frequency in the population. Note that many of the
names shown in Table 2 rank near the lower end of the 1000-name list. However, there
are exceptions. JACKSON, which is held 53 percent of the time by Blacks, is the 18th
most common last name. NGUYEN, held 96 percent of the time by Asian/Pacific
islanders, is the 57th most frequent name.

Some groups, notably, Whites, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics, demonstrate very
high ‘ownership’ of some names – at levels exceeding ninety percent. These situations
constitute places where a given name can, with high certainty, be assumed to be held by a
person of a single specific race. Note that the relative distribution of the group in the
overall population is somewhat irrelevant to this – Whites constitute 70 percent of the
overall population in these data, and Hispanics are 12 percent, but Asian/Pacific Islanders
are only 3.7 percent, yet dominate the ten names most singly-associated with their race
group.



4. METHODOLOGY OF MEASURING NAMES

4.1 Turning names into data

Turning a written name on a census form into usable data for tabulation purposes is a task
which involves a number of assumptions and decision rules. This section describes both
the operational and logical decision rules used to turn ‘names into data’.

As was discussed earlier, the data for this research comes from the written-in names
persons provided when they filled out their census form. In most cases, answers to
questions in the census are made by marking an appropriate box among a list of answers.
For example, to designate one’s sex, the respondent chooses from two boxes, one labeled
‘male’, the other labeled ‘female’, and marks the box that best describes them. In the
process of transforming the marks into data, the mark is ‘read’ in the scanning process,
and is then assigned a value by the OCR software (such as 1 for male, 2 for female).

Some items, such as race and relationship, allow a respondent to either mark a box, or if
they feel no box is appropriate, to write in a response. Other items, such as language, are
write-in only. In cases such as these, all write-ins must eventually either be assigned a
numeric value, or excluded as an unacceptable or inappropriate response In the case of
language, for example, the Census Bureau codes about 360 unique languages, each with
its own numeric coding value (so, for example, language code # 625 corresponds to the
language “Spanish”). Obviously, many factors enter into the process of turning a written
response on paper into a numerically–coded value. For instance, alternate spellings,
including incorrect spellings, random marks on the paper, abbreviations, etc., must all
have decision rules associated with them, in order to code them. Doing so makes it
possible to have a reasonable number of coded languages: while the Census has 380



                                             6
distinct language codes, it received well over 100,000 unique character strings or
“words” that people wrote down as their language.

Transformation of names into data follows much the same route, but is much more
complex, engaging a larger set of rules and procedures. In addition to the possible
sources of error already mentioned, a number of other issues relevant to the character
strings defining names come into play. This includes things such as: 1) scanning or
reading errors by the OCR software, 2) mis-keying, 3) respondents entering data into
incorrect locations in questionnaires, 4) respondents entering no name or an invalid name,
and 5) concatenation of multiple name parts (e.g, first and initial) when they are written
in the space for a single name. Each of these problems must be addressed either with
some kind of editing or resolution rule, or the name must be left as is. It is due to many
of these issues that there are a large number of ‘names’ which occur only once or twice –
many of these ‘unique’ names are variants of more common names which short of
inspection on a one-by-one basis, cannot be “corrected” to the character string they
actually are supposed to represent.


4.2 Definition of a name

For purposes of these tabulations, a captured name from Census 2000 is considered to be
“valid” if it satisfies the following two criteria:

1. Both the first and last names must have at least two alphabetic characters.

2. A first or last name may also be considered valid if it has support in the Social Security
Administration’s 1998 NUMIDENT file. The NUMIDENT file used in this research is a
5 percent sample of all people who had been issued Social Security numbers as of
November 1998. The advantage of using the NUMIDENT file as a benchmark is that
individuals receive Social Security cards with the names they provide on their
applications. If an individual receives a card with an error in their name, they have an
incentive to report the error and have it corrected. Thus, it is assumed that the
NUMIDENT file is the most current and correct source for validating names. The
NUMIDENT file contains the most recent name (first and last) and demographic
characteristics (sex, date of birth, and race) of each individual on it, as of the date of its
production. The NUMIDENT file was not screened to eliminate deceased individuals
nor those living outside the United States in November 1998. Twenty million people are
represented in the sample, about one-fourteenth of the number of people enumerated in
Census 2000. Thus, on average, the ratio of the Census 2000 count for a name (last, male
first, or female first) to the NUMIDENT sample count should be about 14 to 1. Ratios
far larger than 14 to 1 indicate possible “invalid” names. In this project, a census-
captured name with a ratio of approximately 50 or more to 1 triggered an investigation
into its validity and whether it should be changed or deleted.

Records with names that did not satisfy the two criteria were deleted for purposes of
these tabulations. For example, names such as A LINCOLN or MISTER T would be



                                              7
ruled invalid because neither the first name A nor the last name T contains two letters,
thus violating criterion 1. Another example of an invalid name under criterion 1 would
include a string like PETERJDAVIS as a first name, along with a blank last name. In this
case, while it is possible that the correct name is PETER J DAVIS, the action of the
respondent in writing the entire name in the space allotted for the first name only means
there is no name in the space for the last name, thus violating criterion 1.

Some persons originally had blanks in either or both of their name fields, and thus failed
criterion 1. Titles such as JR, SR and III were removed from the last name field, but not
from the first name field. Intervening blanks and hyphens were also deleted. So, for
example, the last names of LOPEZ-GARCIA, LOPEZ GARCIA and LOPEZGARCIA
were all retained as LOPEZGARCIA. A similar example for the first name MARY
ANN would show that it appears in the file as the concatenated entry MARYANN.

Examples of invalid names under criterion 2 are strings such as PERSON (as a first
name), ADULT, BABY, HOUSEHOLDER, or SPOUSE. Thus, a census record with the
name BABY MILLER would have been dropped from the analysis, because BABY is not
supported as a valid name in the NUMIDENT file. In general, criterion 2 was applied
independently to first names and last names. However, the “complete names” (that is,
first and last name in combination) of JOHN DOE and JANE DOE were ruled invalid
because the proportion of the people who reported the last name DOE and who also
reported a first name of JOHN or JANE is far higher in the Census records file than in the
NUMIDENT file. Other possibly invalid names like ELMER FUDD and MICKEY
MOUSE remain on the file because we did not subject all complete names to the process
used for JOHN and JANE DOE.

As names become less frequent, the possibility that a string of letters is not a valid name
increases. As has been noted, this is due to many factors – misplaced or mis-scanned
letter(s), bad spelling, and a variety of other causes. All names occurring 300 or more
times were reviewed for validity, using a series of rules described in section 4.4.5,
although certainly this process did not delete or modify all invalid names. However,
names occurring fewer than 300 times were not examined at all, because of their large
relative volume.

The initial data file used for this report contains 279,132,770 data-defined person records
(census records with at least two data fields with valid responses) from an intermediate
file created during the processing for Census 2000. After applying the criteria and the
edits we developed for improving names, the final number of records for analysis
comprises 269,762,087 people, or approximately 96 percent of all people counted in
Census 2000.

4.3 Editing names

A variety of edits were developed to improve the quality of the name strings. Simply
summarized, the edits attempted to identify and resolve a series of basic problems in
name strings. These edits include:

   1) elimination of some characters to yield a cleaner name
   2) resolving similar but inconsistent last names within households
   3) switching transposed first and last names

Not every possible edit that might be imagined to ‘clean up’ names was developed. Two
examples of edits not made are noted here. One edit not developed would ‘break apart’
those names entered by respondents as single string. It is not uncommon for people to
write in their full name in the last name space, realize they have made an error, and then
write in their first name again in the first name space. Based on visual inspection of
subsets of single-occurrence names, we believe this error may account for the large
number of “unique” names. An edit to break apart compound names was considered too
intensive a task for this research, and since compound names only account for a small
fraction of the total population, it is unlikely they would change the overall distribution of
names in the population in any substantively significant way.

The list of edits undertaken and resultant impact on data records is detailed in Appendix
A.

4.4 Edits

4.4.1 The preliminary edit

The preliminary edit performed several minor operations to produce cleaner names. It
implemented the Criterion 1 rule that both the first and last names of a respondent needed
to contain at least two letters for retention. Titles, such as JR, SR, III, and IV, which
were either separated from first names by spaces or erroneously concatenated, were
removed. JOHN DOE and JANE DOE records were deleted. Names with embedded
numerals (e.g., HEN6RY) had the numerals deleted. Finally, CHRISTOPHEJR and
CHRISTOPHESR were edited to CHRISTOPHER. (First names are limited to 13
captured characters. The problem – truncation by the respondent in order to fit in a
“JR/SR” title -- occurred to the name CHRISTOPHER with great frequency, nearly
15,000 times.)

The count of first names edited or deleted was 5,637,813. The vast majority of these
changes were the removal of titles




                                              9
4.4.2 Edit 1: Removing dangling initials

As noted above, the modifications applied to the basic file removed most embedded
blanks. Because many middle initials were entered in either the first or last name field
and not in the box marked “M.I.,” the preliminary edit deleted the intervening blanks,
causing these middle initials to be concatenated to names. In order to trim the dangling
initials, the ratio of the name as captured (e.g., JOHNL) to its stem name (e.g., JOHN)
was computed and compared to the similar ratio from the NUMIDENT file. For each
name type (last, male first, or female first), a threshold value for each letter appended to
the stem name was created. If a name in the census file had fewer than a prespecified
threshold value of occurrences (generally in the range of 1 to 2 per thousand), the name
was contracted back to the stem name. For example, JOHNL, SMITHB, and
JENNIFERG were edited to JOHN, SMITH, and JENNIFER, respectively, while
CAROL(E), ROBERT(O), and BROWN(E) are retained as CAROLE, ROBERTO, and
BROWNE, respectively. In other words, when the ratio of the count of a name with an
appended initial to its stem is small, it is assumed that the appended name is the actual
name.

Dangling initials were eliminated from 2,226,434 last names.


4.4.3 Edit 2: Making last names agree within households

While we recognize that Mr. SMITH and Ms. JOHNSON may reside in the same
household, generally within many households one would expect most of the last names to
agree. However, when Mr. SMITH and Ms. SNITH share a household, it is likely that
one of the two last names was captured incorrectly. Working on the assumption that
people within households share last names, edit 2 operated on all two-or-more-person
households where at least two individuals had differently-spelled last names. This is
done using a method called a “string comparator”. Simply put, a string comparator
“score” quantifies the degree to which two strings are the same. Factors such as length of
the string, as well as similarity in specific characters, enter into the score assigned to two
compared strings. If two strings are exactly the same, they have a comparator score of
1.0. If they are highly dissimilar (no letters in common) they have a value of zero. Table
3 shows six examples of name pairs with their comparator scores.

KNIGHT                        DAY                                                 .0000

Table 3 shows that KNIGHT and DAY are very dissimilar, as one would expect, so their
value is 0. Slight variations in short strings, such as WORD, WARD and WOOD, lead to
lower scores than a small variation in a longer string, such as BROWN. Relatively high
scores accrue to longer strings with only small variations, such as
PADEREWSKI/PADERAWSKI.

In this research, the Lynch-Winkler (1994) string comparator was used to help measure
the similarity between each pair of last names whose lengths differed by no more than
one letter. Two names were judged to be similar based on a combination of the
comparator score and the frequency of the less frequent name. When the string
comparator score of two last names exceeded the prespecified threshold shown in Table
4, we computed the initial frequencies of the two last names and changed the less
frequent last name to the more frequent one. Table 4 shows the criteria for editing last
names. If the string comparator returns the score in the left column, the less frequent
name is edited to the more frequent name, when the former’s frequency is less than the
value shown in the right column. Thus, in a household with a SMITH and a SNITH, the
SNITH entry was edited to SMITH. For a fuller description of this algorithm, see the
discussion in Coleman, Word, and Nunziata (2003).

4.4.4 Edit 3: Correcting transposed names

Despite extensive testing and development of the census questionnaire, not every
respondent answers questions in the way we expect them to. Particularly in the case of
write-in information, respondents often fail to detect directions or cues that are intended
to assist them in providing their response in a correct manner. One common error made
by respondents in entering their name is the tendency to transpose their name, that is, to
write their first name in the space provided for their last name, and to write their last
name in the space provided for their first name. A preliminary examination of the data
showed that respondents did occasionally transpose their names on their Census 2000
forms. That is, they wrote their last name in the first name field and vice versa. Edit 3
sought to reduce these errors while not introducing new transposition errors. Analysis of
a sample of data after Edit 2 suggested that about 1 in 170 respondents transposed their
names, or a probability of transposition of about 0.6 percent. Thus, the 0.6 percent
probability was used to create a threshold to trigger transposition of the captured name.

One intuitively believes that a male named “SMITH JOHN has most likely transposed his
name, given that SMITH and JOHN are the most common last and male first names,
respectively and that these names rarely occur in the reverse order. However, intuition
cannot determine whether or not a male captured as THOMAS JAMES should be
transposed to JAMES THOMAS, as both THOMAS and JAMES frequently occur as
both last names and male first names. Edit 3 operationalizes these intuitions by creating
an odds ratio that a name as captured was transposed. The nature of names makes it
possible to define an odds ratio measure to detect whether a name as captured was likely
to have been transposed.

The odds that a first name, such as JOHN, is correct as captured is essentially the ratio
count of JOHN as a first name for the given sex to the count of JOHN as a last name for
the same sex. The computation of the odds for a last name, such as SMITH, is done
similarly. Two complications occur. The first is simply the possibility of a zero in the
numerator or denominator of the odds ratio. To remedy this, we add an arbitrary small
number, 0.5, to the initial counts of both the first and last names. The second is the
possibility of spuriously increased last name counts for a sex due to contamination by
transpositions of first names. For this reason, we use the minimum count by sex for last
names. For example, although JENNIFER is a legitimate but infrequent last name, the
number of females with the last name JENNIFER greatly exceeds the number of males
with the last name JENNIFER, since JENNIFER as a first name is almost exclusively
female. Transposition by females spuriously increases the count of females with last
name JENNIFER, while males with the last name JENNIFER are virtually unaffected.
Taking the minimum of the two counts gets closer to the true count of females (or males)
with last name JENNIFER.

The odds ratio, R, is the product of the odds that the first name as given is correct, R1, and
the odds that the last name as given is correct, R2. Table 5 shows the four ways that a
name can be captured.

                       The Four Ways That a Name Can Be Captured

                                                                       Sex
Position                                                            Male                                 Female
First                                                                 w                                       x
Last                                                                   y                                      z

The variables w, x, y and z are the counts for a given name in the four cells.

Given a first name, last name pair and a sex, we can compute the components of the odds
ratio R. Let the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the first and last names, respectively. For
females, R1 = (x1 + 0.5) / (min(y1, z1) + 0.5) and R2 = (min(y2, z2) + 0.5) / (x2 + 0.5).
Likewise, for males, R1 = (w1 + 0.5) / (min(y1, z1) + 0.5) and R2 = (min(y2, z2) + 0.5) / (w2
+ 0.5).

Now, given a respondent’s full name after Edit 2 (first_name, last_name) and his/her sex
S, which can take the values M for male and F for female, the odds ratio R that the name
as captured is correct, as opposed to being transposed, is computed as

                       first_name1S + 0.5                  min(last_name 2 M , last_name 2 F ) + 0.5
        R=                                               ×                                           ,    (1)
             min(first_name 2 M , first_name 2 F ) + 0.5             last_name1S + 0.5


where first_nametX and last_nametX are the total counts of first_name and last_name as
names of type t, where t = 1, 2 denote first and last names, respectively, for sex X, where
M is male and F is female. The first term in equation (1) is the odds that the first name as
captured is correct, assuming independence between first and last names. The second
term is the odds that the last name as captured is correct, again assuming independence.

Table 6 illustrates the results of applying this algorithm. For four name pairs, it shows
the odds ratio that the entries as captured were not transposed and the probabilities that
they are correct. For purposes of Table 6, last names are assumed to be divided equally
between the two sexes.

In the first two pairs, the odds that the captured names are transposed are overwhelming,
much less than the 1:170 (i.e., R < 0.006) threshold needed to trigger transposition by
Edit 3. In the JENNIFER KING example, Edit 3 would transpose the two name entries.
LINDA SMITH, on the other hand, has almost certainly been captured correctly, given
the massively large odd ration it produces. THOMAS JAMES is a more interesting
situation. The R value is far above .006, translating to a probability of correctness of
0.38, which means not even a 50-50 chance that it is transposed. Thus, when a male
gives his name as THOMAS JAMES, we have insufficient evidence to transpose it.
Likewise, a male giving his name as JAMES THOMAS also lacks sufficient evidence of
transposition.

The count of edits via transposition was 1,352,881. The numbers of first and last names
changed are equal.


4.4.5 Edit 4: Edits of large occurrence names

At the completion of the preedit and edits 1 through 3, all first and last names which had
300 or more occurrences were further reviewed. During this process three additional
edits were implemented.

4.4.5.1 Edit 4, Part a: Editing or deleting invalid first and last names

The first part of this edit implemented the Criterion 2 rule (validation from the SSA
NUMIDENT file), and compared counts of all names with at least 300 occurrences to
their respective counts in the 5 percent sample of the Social Security NUMIDENT file.
For each name of each type (last, male first, and female first), we computed the ratio of
Census file occurrences after Edit 3 to the NUMIDENT sample occurrences. Names
which either did not occur at all in the NUMIDENT sample or had ratios of 50:1 or
greater were then determined to be either invalid (BABY, BOY, GIRL), mis-scanned
(HAII for HALL), or misspelled (JOESPH for JOSEPH). Mis-scanned and misspelled
names were edited to the most likely alternative; invalid names were deleted.
This edit resulted in 97,129 deletions.

4.4.5.2 Edit 4, Part b: Deleting spurious multiplicates

The second part of this edit involved an examination of records where the exact name and
date of birth occurred six or more times. While the majority were due to coincidence
(e.g., LINDA SMITH born September 30, 1947 and JOSE HERNANDEZ born March
19, 1963), some seemed invalid – multiple occurrences on the same form, or in the same
specific geographic place. These spurious records may have resulted from respondents
entering their names multiple times on the same form, or from a respondent completing
multiple forms. All identified spurious multiplicate records were deleted.
The counts of these edits and deletions were: first names, 711,027; last names, 215,743.




                                            14
4.4.5.3 Edit 5: Spurious male first initials

A final examination revealed a few male first names where it appeared that a single letter
was attached to the beginning of a valid name. For example, if F. Scott Fitzgerald gave
his first name as F SCOTT, the file would have retained it as FSCOTT. This edit was
similar to Edit 1, with the difference that the first letter of various names was trimmed.
This edit was only applied to male first names, as no female first name occurring more
than 300 times had this type of error.

The number of male first names edited was 124,118.

4.4.6 Edits summary

In all, 8,701,943 changes were made to first names and 10,266,502 to last names. In
every instance, the original name had fewer occurrences than the name to which it was
changed. Since every change had to result from the application of a replicable edit rule,
many errors in names were not corrected, and as noted earlier, likely result in many of the
unique occurrence names in the file. Nevertheless, we believe the quality of the resulting
name files is considerably higher than that of the initial, unedited data.


4.4.7 Definitions of race and Hispanic origin used in this report

The race categories shown in these files are the modified race categories used in the
Census Bureau’s population estimates program. The Census Bureau’s population
estimates program modified the Census 2000 race data to eliminate the “Some Other
Race” category to be more consistent with the race categories that appear on the
administrative records used to produce population estimates.

The race modification generally conforms to the Office of Management and Budget’s
(OMB, 1997) standards for collecting and presenting data on race and ethnicity. The
OMB (1997) standards identified five race categories: 1) White, 2) Black or African
American, 3) American Indian and Alaska Native, 4) Asian, and 5) Native Hawaiian and
Other Pacific Islander. Additionally, OMB (1997) recommended that respondents be
able to select one or more races to indicate their racial identity. For respondents unable
to identify with any of the five race categories, OMB (1997) approved including a sixth
category - “Some Other Race” – on the Census 2000 questionnaires.

About 18.5 million people checked “Some Other Race” alone or in combination with one
or more other races. These people were primarily of Hispanic origin and many wrote in a
specific Hispanic-origin type (e.g., Mexican or Puerto Rican) as their race. To conform
to the U.S. Census Bureau’s population estimates program’s race definitions, responses
that were only “Some Other Race” were modified by blanking the “Some Other Race”
response and imputing one or more OMB standard races. Standard Census Bureau
procedures achieved the imputation by assigning the race response(s) of another Census
respondent who had the same response to the Hispanic-origin question. Reponses that



                                            15
included both “Some Other Race” and one or more OMB standard races were modified
just by blanking the “Some Other Race” response.

For purposes of this report, all people were categorized into six mutually exclusive racial
and Hispanic origin groups. People indicating that they were Hispanic were categorized
as Hispanic, regardless of race. The remaining non-Hispanic population was collapsed
into five non-Hispanic race categories: 1) White only, 2) Black only, 3) American Indian
and Alaskan Native only, 4) Asian and Pacific Islander only, and 5) Two or More Races.
Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders were combined with Asians because of the
former group’s small total – only 398,835 people reported these races, out of a total U.S.
population of 281,421,906. This combination is also consistent with the OMB race
classification used before 1997.


5. DATAFILE DOCUMENTATION

5.1 General

This report is accompanied by two datafiles containing summary data on last name
frequencies. Tabulations with demographic characteristics are available for all surnames
occurring at least 100 times in Census 2000. The number 100 was chosen to eliminate
those names with very low counts, thus assuring confidentiality. Placing a floor of 100
on the frequencies protects individuals privacy, but does eliminate data on millions of
names. Information is provided for 151,671 surnames, covering about 89.8 percent of the
population. 1

The data associated with this report are contained in the Appendix and in two electronic
files (A and B). Appendix Table A-1 contains a printed list on the 50 most frequently
occurring last names. File A consists of a CSV (comma separated values) file of the
1,000 most frequently occurring last names, similar in format to Appendix Table A-1.
File B consists of a CSV file of all names occurring at least 100 times, constituting
151,671 records. In all tables, cell values between 1 and 4 were suppressed to maintain
confidentiality; resulting percentages may, therefore, not sum to 100.

The data include two fields identified as “proportion per 100,000 people” and
“cumulative proportion per 100,000 people.” The number 100,000 is convenient for
expressing these proportions, as it reduces the need to show many digits after the decimal
point. The term “cumulative proportion” indicates the proportion of the total population
covered by that name and all more frequent names.


5.2 File A: Excel File of 1,000 Most Frequently Occurring Surnames



1
 The percentages reported in this paragraph use the total number of people (total, male, female) with valid
names as determined by this report as the denominators.


                                                    16
File A is similar in format to Appendix Table A-1, with the difference being that the first
row contains field labels and the subsequent 1,000 rows contain data. The file is in Excel
format, suitable for import into many software packages.
